# MSShortCut
Python3.4 implementation to parse MSWindows shortcuts

The class was inspired by an contribution from stackoverview question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/397125/reading-the-target-of-a-lnk-file-in-python

I placed this copy here so other might use, extend or whatever.  Note that I just copied the code but had to make a couple of minor edits for details private to my environment (just debugging stuff).  I didn't verify that it still loads cleanly in python, but it's likely.

Enjoy!
